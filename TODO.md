## Task list

Ordered roughly in priority:

- Better test cases for name generation around arrays, and duplicate keys

- Unit tests for individual methods (once codebase a bit less volatile)
- Add a callback for altering the classes/properties once their types are fully known
- Support 1-2 common serialisation libs out of the box
- Create command line tool + website (essential for convenience)
