## Task list

Ordered roughly in priority:

- Better test cases for object serialisation (not related to de-duping)
- Better test cases for array serialisation (not related to de-duping)
- Better test cases for name generation, particularly around arrays, and duplicate keys
- Better test cases for de-duplication of arrays/objects
- Test cases with real-world JSON


- Unit tests for individual methods (once codebase a bit less volatile)
- Add a callback for altering the classes/properties once their types are fully known
- Support 1-2 common serialisation libs out of the box
- Create command line tool + website (essential for convenience)
